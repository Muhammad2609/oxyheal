                <p class="review-content">Just wanted to say a massive thank you to OxyHeal! I suffer from a chronic skin condition for 10 years, and my skin becomes irritated at least once every week. Ever since I‚Äôve started OxyHeal, I haven‚Äôt experienced any issues for the whole month. It‚Äôs such a unique and natural method that has helped me more than any medication or ointments. I haven‚Äôt felt at peace with my condition in so long until now. It‚Äôs really helped me a lot! PS: the staff is so lovely and accommodating, and the sessions are very comfortable and relaxing.</p>

                <p class="review-content">I had 6 HBOT treatments here and will continue to have more. The owner is lovely, very knowledgeable about Oxygen treatments. Easy to book and very good prices, compared to other places in London. I felt instant benefits of having treatment. The pain in my body subsided, and I had lots of energy. At first, I was nervous to use the chamber, but the owner takes her time and sits with you throughout your whole treatment. Thanks so much üôè I'm glad I found you.</p>

                <p class="review-content">I've done about 4 sessions so far to help with post-surgery recovery and have seen improvements in my bruising and pain levels. I was looking for a calm relaxed environment and Shahina was great from the first phone call; really happy to provide information with no upselling so I felt really comfortable coming in and doing my treatments. Shahina explained everything so well, and the chamber itself is really relaxing. Great service and treatment!</p>

                <p class="review-content">HBOT has transformed my recovery after intense workouts. I feel rejuvenated and ready to conquer the next challenge, not just physically but mentally too! It's truly a holistic well-being experience. My skin has never looked better! Thank you Shahina; you're the greatest!</p>

                <p class="review-author">Medelyn Serrano</p>
                <p class="review-content">Oxyheal is the best hyperbaric and normobaric oxygen therapy provider for us. Our daughter has autism and other special needs. Trying anything we could to help my daughter, we have come across HBOT and NBOT. Luckily enough, we found a gem provider in the heart of Newham - Oxyheal. Shahina and family treat us well and understand our needs. Shahina is very knowledgeable about the service the business provides and also understands the needs of her clients. We have been with Oxyheal since mid-2021 and will still continue as long as my daughter needs it. Prices are reasonable, and booking appointments is not a problem at all. Will definitely recommend to those who are looking for an HBOT provider.</p>
